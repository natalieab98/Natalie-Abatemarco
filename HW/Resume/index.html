    <h2> <i> About Me </i></h2>
    <p> My passion for public relations, writing, and fashion has always been a significant part of my life in the bustling and dynatmic setting of New York. I study public relations as a student in the Honors Program in the School of Communications at the University of Miami. I am a writer with a demonstrated history of working in the enwspaper and magazine industry. I enjoy using my skills in Adobe programs, creativity, organization, and interaction with others while remaining energetic.</p>
